<h1>The Best Movies According to Harshit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>I like romantic movies and this is the greatest romantic movie of all time. Even in tragedy, someone can find love.</p>
<h3>Avengers(2012)</h3>
<p>The first avengers movie is has all the elements in it like the comedy, tragedy, love, the VFX and one of the things that I like it mostly for is the brightness of this movie. Most superhero movies are dull nowadays because of excessive CGI used.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>This movie has a great storyline and the direction is masterclass.</p>
